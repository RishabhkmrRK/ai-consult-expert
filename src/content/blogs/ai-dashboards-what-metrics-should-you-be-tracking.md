## Why Metrics Matter More Than Ever

With AI doing the heavy lifting on data collection and processing, your job is no longer crunching numbers—it’s interpreting them. **Dashboards powered by AI** give you a live view into what’s working and what needs fixing.

But not all metrics are worth your time. So which ones should you focus on?

## 🎯 Start With the Business Goal

Before you build a dashboard, ask:  
**What decision will this data help me make?**

Different goals require different metrics:
- **Marketing team?** Focus on engagement and ROI.
- **Sales team?** Monitor lead velocity and conversion.
- **Operations?** Track task completion and cycle times.
