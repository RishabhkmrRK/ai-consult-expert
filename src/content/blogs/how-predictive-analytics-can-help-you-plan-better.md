## 📈 What Is Predictive Analytics?

Predictive analytics uses **historical data, AI, and statistical algorithms** to forecast future outcomes. It doesn't just tell you what happened—it helps you **predict what will happen next.**

### Key Techniques Include:
- **Regression models** (e.g. predicting revenue next quarter)
- **Time-series analysis** (e.g. seasonal demand)
- **Classification models** (e.g. customer churn prediction)
- **Machine learning** that improves accuracy over time
