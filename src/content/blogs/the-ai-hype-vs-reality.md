## AI Is Not a Magic Wand

AI can automate and enhance many processes, but itâ€™s not a cure-all. Successful AI adoption requires clear goals, good data, and ongoing managementâ€”not just flipping a switch.

## You Still Need Human Insight

AI models analyze patterns and make predictions, but humans are essential for context, ethics, and decision-making. AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement.

## Implementation Takes Time and Resources

Integrating AI solutions involves investment in tools, training, and sometimes technical support. Quick wins are possible, but patience is key to long-term success.

## AI Can Create New Opportunities

While AI can reduce costs and save time, it also enables new products, services, and business models that were previously impossible.

## Beware of Overpromising Vendors

Not all AI products deliver on their claims. Research, pilot projects, and working with trusted consultants help avoid costly mistakes.
